### Chapter 15
# Packages: How Your Source Code is Organized

Imagine you have two classes, one of which represents a component that reads
data from the console. Simiarly, the other class represents a device
which scans papers. Although both the classes are different in functionality,
both the classes can be named `Scanner`. So far, you have learnt that you cannot
declare two classes with the same name. An obvious solution is to name these
classes differently.

However, Zen provides a feature known as package that allows you to create
namespaces. In this chapter, you will learn about creating packages and importing
packages.
