You can use any identifier you wish to name your packages. However, we recommend
you to follow these naming conventions when you create your packages.

 * Packages are usually named using the authors domain name. The domain name
   is written backwards to obtain the package name.
 
   For example, imagine you own the domain `example.com`. You can create a
   package named `com.example` for all your packages.
   
   Using your domain name allows you to create package names which are unique
   from the packages created by other programmers around the world.
   
 * Package names are usually written in lowercase letters. This helps you to
   avoid conflicts with class names.
   
 * You can add other subpackages to the package named after your domain.
   For example, you can create a program named `Tesla` and place all its source
   files under the `com.example.tesla` package. It can further contain other
   subpackages.
