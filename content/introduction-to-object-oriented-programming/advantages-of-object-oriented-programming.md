In this section, we will learn about the advantages of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Reusability

Reusability allows us to reuse available facilities rather building it again
and again. This is done with the use of a class. You can use it any number of
times. Thus, your productivity is improved.

## Maintenance

Code maintainance is a necessity for any programming languages. Object Oriented
Programming allows programmers to refactor code in many ways.

## Security

With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, you limit data exposure
to the world outside your class. This reduces accidental modification of your
data.

## Problem Solving

Decomposing a complex problem into smaller components is a good practice. 
Object Oriented Programming is specialized in this style, as it breaks down
your problem into objects.

In fact, these objects can be reused in creating solutions to different problems.
