# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

Zen is a pure object-oriented programming language. When you work with Zen, you
primarily use objects to get things done. You create objects, modify them,
change their attributes, call their methods, and combine them with other objects.

This chapter is a simple introduction to object-oriented programming. It
introduces some of the basic concepts and terms you need to know before
moving to the following chapters.

Some concepts in this chapter are confusing. Do not worry, if you do not get
them right away. By the end of this manual you will be comfortable with these
concepts.
