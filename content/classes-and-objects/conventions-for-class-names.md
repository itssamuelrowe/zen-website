Your class name is an identifier. You can use any identifier you want. But we
suggest you to follow these guidelines.

 * Begin the class name with a capital letter. For example, `Bike`, `Car`,
  `Planet` and `Person`.
 * If the class name consists of more than one word, capitalize each word.
  For example, `BikeRace`, `CarGame`, `CollegeLibrary` and `StringBuilder`.
 * Try to use nouns for your class names. We know that classes represent real
  life objects. In the real word, you identify objects with nouns. Hence,
  we recommend you to use nouns for naming your classes.
