# Conditional Statements: How Your Programs Make Choices

So far in this book, all the programs have run in a linear fashion. In
other words, your programs simply ran from start to finish with each
statement being executed one after the other. However, in most real-life
situations, your programs will need to make decisions whether to skip a
few statements, repeat things multiple times, or even jump from one
part of your code to another part. Such actions are performed using
control statements. You will learn about these statements in this chapter
and the next chapter.

A programming language provides control statements that allow your
programs to alter the flow of execution. Zen’s control statements are
divided into the following categories: selection, iteration, and jump.

## Selection Statement

Selection statements allow your program to choose different paths of
execution based on a Boolean expression. They are also known as
conditional statements. They are the focus of this chapter.

## Iteration Statement

Iteration statements enable your program to repeat one or more
statements in your code. They are also known as loop statements. You
will learn more about these statements in the next chapter.

## Jump Statements

By far, jump statements are the simplest control statements. As the
name suggests, they allow your program to jump from one location to
another location. Given their simplicity, they don’t get their own
chapter. However, we explain them in detail whenever their usage is
required or when a concept is closely associated with them.

In this chapter, we will learn about the selection statements in Zen. You
discover two Zen statements that let your programs make decisions.
First you will learn about the if statement which allows you to execute a
statement or a block of statements based on a Boolean condition. After
which, you will learn about the switch statement, which is an elegant
version of the if statement.

The if statement relies heavily on the use of Boolean expressions. In
general, these expressions produce true or false. Which is why, this
chapter begins by showing you how to write simple Boolean expressions
that test the value of a variable. You have already learnt the various
logical and comparison operators, which produce Boolean values. You
can always go back to the previous chapter to jog your memory
