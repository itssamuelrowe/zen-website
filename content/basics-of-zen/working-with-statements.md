Statements are similar to sentences in the English language. A statement tells
Zen to perform an action. It can include one or more *expressions*.

There are two types of statements in Zen:
    * Simple Statement
    * Compound Statement

## Understanding Simple Statements

Simple statements are the actions your program performs.

 * Assertion Statement
 * Break Statement
 * Continue Statement
 * Empty Statement
 * Expression Statement
 * Return Statement and
 * Throw Statement

A simple statement always ends with a newline. Most programming languages
such as C, C++, and Java expect a simple statement to be terminated with a
semicolon. In languages such as JavaScript and Python, the semicolon is
optional.

The example shown here is an expression statement. Therefore, it is
*terminated* with a newline.

```
print('Hello, world!')
```

## Understanding Compound Statements

Compound statements help you group simple statements and control them. They
are always associated with blocks.

 * Block Statement
 * For Statement
 * If Statement
 * Synchronize Statement
 * Try Statement
 * While Statement
