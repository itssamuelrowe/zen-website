title = "Understanding Keywords"
+++

A *keyword* is a special word whose meaning is defined by the Zen programming
language specification. **You cannot use these words as identifiers**.
All keywords are in lowercase.

Like everything else in Zen, keywords are case sensitive. For example, if you
use `For` with uppercase `F` instead of `for` with lowercase `f` it is an error.

The hello world program shown in the beginning of this chapter use one keyword:
`function`.

In Zen there are 36 keywords. They are listed below in alphabetical order.

| Keywords | | | | |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| abstract | and       | assert    | break       | catch    |
| class    | continue  | else      | enum        | extends  | 
| false    | final     | finally   | for         | function |
| if       | import    | is        | native      | new      | 
| null     | or        | private   | public      | return   | 
| secret   | static    | super     | synchronize | this     | 
| throw    | true      | try       | var         | while    |
| with     |
