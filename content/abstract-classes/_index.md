### Chapter 13
# Abstract Classes

Abstraction is an important concept of object-oriented programming. Humans see
and understand things through abstraction. For example, you do not perceive a
car as thousands of individual parts. Instead you think of it as a an object with
its own unique behavior.

Abstraction allows you to drive a car without having to know the details of its
internal mechanisms. If you know to drive a Lamborghini, you can easily drive
a Ferrari. But then, internally the engines of a Lamborghini and a Ferrari do not
work the same way. Which means, the behavior does not change from instance to
instance but rather it changes between types of an object.

In this chapter, we will learn more about abstraction, polymorphism, and abstract
classes.
