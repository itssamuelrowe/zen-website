A function is a block of statements. You can give it a name. When a function is
declared inside a class, it defines an object's behavior, basically whatever an
object is capable of performing.

You can call or invoke a function with its name. When you invoke a function, the
execution of your program branches to the body of that function. When the function
is finished, execution resumes from where the program branched, and the program
continues on to the next statement.

You have already used functions. For example, `print` and `prompt` are
functions declared in the `ZenHelper` class.
