### Chapter 10
# Functions

In Zen all programs are built with classes, which means there is at least
one class. Further, every program must have at least one function, the `main()`
function. That is it. Beyond that, you do not need to create other functions.
But, without functions, often your code will contain a lot of duplicate instructions.

In this chapter, you will learn how to create your own functions, invoking functions,
accepting parameters, and finally returning values from functions.
