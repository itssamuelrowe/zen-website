The primary advantages of functions are as follows.
 * Functions improve the quality of your code. They make it more readable because
   you break your code into logical chunks.
 * You avoid duplicate code. Imagine you are writing an application that simulates
   an airplane, which requires primitive matrix operations such as addition,
   subtraction and multiplication. Without functions you would have to write these
   operations in several places. So whenever you see yourself writing the same
   code, it is a good idea to write a function.
 * You can implement polymorphism through functions. This is one of the most
   important features of functions.
