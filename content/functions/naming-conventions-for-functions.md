 * Begin function names with a lowercase letter. For example, `print`, `getName`,
  `setTitle` and `buffer`.
 * If the function name consists of more than one word, capitalize every word,
  except the first word. For example, `toString`, `initializeCamera`, `launchRocket`
  and `parseInteger`.
 * Try to begin your function names with verbs. The name of a function should indicate
   an action.
