# Loop Statements: How Your Programs Repeat Things

One thing computers enjoy doing more than anything else is repeating themselves.

times. Although you may love the show, you would find this a cruel punishment.
Computers on the other hand, do not mind this. In fact, a computer could easily
write this a thousand times in milliseconds.

You need to understand conditional statements to properly understand the concepts
of loops, the if statement in particular.

In this chapter you will learn the three loop statements in Zen.
