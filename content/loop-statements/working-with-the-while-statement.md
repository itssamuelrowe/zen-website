title = "Working with the While Statement"
+++

When it comes to loops, Zen gives you two choices. You can go with the
while loop, which provides enough flexbility to make most programmers
happy, or you can choose the simpler for loop for your programs.

The for statement is clearer and lays out all its plans in one place.
Whereas, the while statement gives you more flexbility. The important thing to
remember is that you can convert a for loop into a while loop, and vice versa.

The while loop is the simplest loop in Zen. It simply executes a loop continuously
as long as a condition is true. While loops are useful in many situations, so
you use them a lot.

Generally in a while loop we say "while this condition is true, keep repeating
this action."

Here is a simple example that shows a while loop in real life. You eat from your
lunch box while there is food in it. Easy enough.

The general form of the while statement is like this.
```
while condition
    body
```

The while statement begins by evaluating the conditional expression. If the
expression is `true`, the body is executed. Then, the conditional expression
is evaluated again, and the whole process repeats. If the expression is `false`,
the body is not executed, and the while loop ends.

Hereâ€™s a simple program that uses a while loop to print the even numbers
from 2 through 10 on the console.

```
// EvenNumbers.zen

function main(...arguments)
    var number = 2
    while number <= 10
        print(number)
        number += 2
```

If you run this program, the following output is displayed on your console.
```
2
4
6
8
10
```

The conditional expression you used in the while loop shown in the previous
example is `number <= 10` (number is less than or equal to 10).
That means the loop repeats as long as the value of number is less
than or equal to `10`.

The body of the loop consists of two statements. The first statement prints the
value of `number`. Then, the second statement adds `2` to `number`.

Notice that we have idented the statements below the while clause. This forms a
statement suite. You can write more than one statement under the while clause.

Here's a flowchart for this program. It can help you visualize the basic decision
making process of a loop.
