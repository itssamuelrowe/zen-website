In this section, you will learn about variables.

A variable is a place holder. A variable's value can change when your program
is running.

For exampe, you can store a value like 100 in a variable. After you store a value,
you can store a different value in the variable whenever you want. When you store
a new value in a variable, the old value is no longer there. In other words, the
old value is replaced by the new value.

The value you can store in a variable is not necessarily a number. In fact, Zen
is dynamically typed. What this means is, you can store any type of value in a
variable. For example, consider a variable called `i` which currently holds a
string. You can later store an integer in `i`.

You can refer the value stored in a variable using a variable's name.
