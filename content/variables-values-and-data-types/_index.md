# Variables, Values, and Data Types

In this chapter, you will learn the basics of working with variables in Java.
Variables are fundamental in making general purpose programs.
In the Hello World program that we studied in the previous chapter 
always prints "Hello, world!". With a variable, you can
make it more general. For example, you could personalize the greeting to wish 
the user with their name.
