### Chapter 11
# Superclasses and Subclasses

Inheritance is a very important feature of object-oriented programming, 
a mechanism which allows one class to inherit the behaviors and attributes
from another class. Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes.
Thus, it has a direct impact on the design of your programs.

To represent a hierarchy, you can create a class that defines characteristics
common to a group of objects. Using inheritance, this class can then be inherited
by other classes which are more specific.

In this chapter, we will learn about inheritance, its mechanisms, and applications.
We will see how to extend superclasses, the behavior of constructors in class hierarchies,
their invocation, and much more.
