      <description>The concepts explained in this section are very important. Do not worry if you find the concepts confusing. You can always come back and read the section later.
You can combine operators to form complex expessions. The order in which the operations are evaluated is determined by the precedence of the operators involved in the expression. For example, multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
Always remember, precedence rules can be overridden by explicit parentheses.</description>

      <title>Overriding Operators</title>

      <description>Zen allows operator overriding through a combination of functions and annotations.
All the operators in Zen are dispatched to a function call. The ZenKernel.evaluate(...) function finds a suitable handler for the operator defined within the operand object and dispatches it. In other words, the compiler translates expressions with operators to equivalent ZenKernel.evaluate(...) calls.
For example, in the HashMap class the following annotation overrides the subscript operator.
@Operator symbol=&#39;[]&#39; function getValue(key) .</description>

      <title>Types of Operators</title>

      <description>In this lecture, we&amp;rsquo;ll learn about the types of operators based on the number of operands they expect.
A common way to categorize Zenâ€™s operators is by the number of operands the operator expect.
There are three types of operators based on the number of operands they accept.
 Unary Operators
 Binary Operators
 Ternary Operators
  Unary Operators Unary operators are operators that expect one operand.</description>

      <title>Understanding Operators</title>

      <description>In this lecture, you will learn about operators.
An operator is a special symbol or a keyword that performs a mathemtical operation or a specific operation.
Generally, an operator expects one, two, or three values known as operands.
You must always remember, an operator always calculates and returns a result.</description>

      <title>Using the Assignment Operators</title>

      <description>The assignment operator helps you assign a value to a variable. You have already seen many examples of this operator. It assigns the value on its right to the operand on its left.
For example, here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the assignment operator in use.
var vehicles var cars = 100 vehicles = cars  In the above example, we created a variable named vehicles. Think that it stores the number of vehicles you own.</description>

      <title>Using the Compound Assignment Operators</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/zen-website/operators-operands-and-expressions/using-the-compound-assignment-operators/</link>

      <description>A compound assignment operator is an operator that performs both an implicit calculation and an assignment.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of all the compound arithmetic assignment operators in Zen.
 Please note that the operators described in the table below are with respect to the Integer8, Integer16, Integer32, Integer64, Decimal32 and Decimal64 data types. For behavior specific to other data types, please refer the documentation.
    Operator Description     += Addition and assignment   -= Subtraction and assignment   *= Multiplication and assignment   /= Division (for quotient) and assignment   %= Division (for remainder) and assignment    For example, the expression a = a + 10 can be written as a += 10.</description>

      <title>Using the Conditional Operator</title>

      <description>The conditional operator is the only ternary operator in Zen. It is used to replace certain types of if-then-else statements. You will learn more about if statements later in the manual.
The conditional operator is represented by a question mark (?). It can seem somewhat confusing at first, but the conditional operator can be used very effectively once understood.
The conditional operator has the following general form.
expression1 ? expression2 : expression3  Here, expression1 can be any expression that evaluates to a boolean value.</description>

      <title>Using the Logical Operators</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/zen-website/operators-operands-and-expressions/using-the-logical-operators/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/zen-website/operators-operands-and-expressions/using-the-logical-operators/</guid>
      <description>You can combine two or more conditions or constraints or complement with logical operators. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a Boolean value, either true or false.
Logical AND Operator The logical AND operator combines two Boolean expressions and returns true if both the expressions evaluate to true. Otherwise, it returns false for the given expressions.
The general form of the logical AND operator is shown here.</description>

      <title>Using the Unary Plus and Minus Operators</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/zen-website/operators-operands-and-expressions/using-the-unary-plus-and-minus-operators/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/zen-website/operators-operands-and-expressions/using-the-unary-plus-and-minus-operators/</guid>
      <description>Please note that the operators described in this section are with respect to the Integer8, Integer16, Integer32, Integer64, Decimal32 and Decimal64 data types. For behavior specific to other data types, please refer the documentation.
 The unary plus and minus operators let you change the sign of an operand.
Note that the symbol used to represent these operators are the same as the addition and subtraction operators. The compiler figures out which operation you mean by examining the expression.</description>

      <description>In this section, you will learn about the arithmetic operators in Zen.
 Please note that the operators described in this section are with respect to the Integer8, Integer16, Integer32, Integer64, Decimal32 and Decimal64 data types. For behavior specific to other data types, please refer the documentation.
 You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with the arithmetic operators. They are similar to operators in basic mathematics.
   Operator Description     + Addition   - Subtraction   * Multiplication   / Division (returns quotient)   % Division (returns remainder)    Addition The addition operator, written as plus + accepts two operands.</description>

 A computer stores data in binary. In other words, information is encoded as a sequence of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s. On most computers, the memory is organized into 8-bit cells known as bytes.
Zen defines several operators that allow you to work at the binary level.</description>

   Operator Description     == Equality   != Inequality    Equality Returns true if the operand on the left is the same as the operand on the right. Please note that this operator compares the content of the left operand with the content of the right operand, along with the references.</description>
